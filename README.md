# CKD

Chronic Kidney Disease

## What is CKD

`CKD means your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood the way they should.`
CKD is also called `chronic renal failure` or `chronic renal insufficiency`.
CKD is a type of kidney disease.

## What causes CKD

There are many causes of CKD. The most common causes are diabetes and high blood pressure. Other causes include:

- Family history of kidney disease
- Heart disease
- Obesity
- Polycystic kidney disease
- Smoking
- Trauma to the kidneys

## What are the symptoms of CKD

The symptoms of CKD are not always obvious. They may not show up until your kidneys are badly damaged. The symptoms of CKD include:

- Blood in the urine
- Decreased urine output
- Fatigue
- Itching
- Loss of appetite
- Muscle cramps
- Nausea
- Swelling of the feet, ankles, legs, or hands
- Vomiting

## How is CKD diagnosed

There are several tests that can be used to diagnose CKD. These include:

- Blood tests
- Urine tests
- Imaging tests

## How is CKD treated

There is no cure for CKD. Treatment focuses on slowing the progression of the disease and preventing complications. Treatment may include:

- Dialysis
- Kidney transplant
- Medications
- Nutrition therapy
- Surgery

## How can I prevent CKD

You can take steps to prevent CKD. These include:

- Eating a healthy diet
- Getting regular exercise
- Maintaining a healthy weight
- Managing diabetes
- Managing high blood pressure
- Not smoking
- Taking medications as prescribed

## What is the outlook for people with CKD

The outlook for people with CKD depends on the stage of the disease. The earlier CKD is diagnosed, the better the outlook. The outlook for people with CKD is also better if they take steps to prevent complications.

## What is the difference between `CKD` and `kidney failure`

The terms CKD and kidney failure are often used interchangeably. However, they are not the same. Kidney failure is a more advanced stage of CKD. Kidney failure means your `kidneys have stopped working`. Kidney failure is also called `end-stage renal disease` or end-stage kidney disease.

## What is the difference between `CKD` and `kidney disease`

The terms CKD and kidney disease are often used interchangeably. However, they are not the same. `Kidney disease` is a `general term` that refers to `any disease that affects the kidneys`.
CKD is a specific type of kidney disease.

## What is the difference between `CKD` and `kidney stones`

The terms CKD and kidney stones are often used interchangeably. However, they are not the same. `Kidney stones are small, hard deposits that form in the kidneys`. CKD is a type of kidney disease.

## What is the difference between `CKD` and `kidney infection`

The terms CKD and kidney infection are often used interchangeably. However, `they are not the same`. A kidney infection is an `infection of the kidneys`. CKD is a type of kidney disease.

## What is the difference between `CKD` and `kidney cancer`

The terms CKD and kidney cancer are often used interchangeably. However, they are not the same. Kidney cancer is a `type of cancer that starts in the kidneys`. CKD is a type of kidney disease.

## What is the difference between `CKD` and `kidney pain`

The terms CKD and kidney pain are often used interchangeably. However, they are not the same. Kidney pain is `pain in the kidneys`. CKD is a type of kidney disease.

# Proposed System

By using machine learning algorithms we try to predict if a person would get CKD based on the given parameters.
The parameters are:

- Age
- Blood Pressure
- Specific Gravity
- Albumin
- Sugar
- Pus Cell clumps
- Bacteria
- Blood Urea
- Serum Creatinine
- Hemoglobin
- White Blood Cell Count
- Red Blood Cell Count
- Hypertension
- Diabetes Mellitus
- Coronary Artery Disease
- Appetite

# Dataset

We have used the Chronic Kidney [Disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 400 instances and 25 attributes.

# Algorithms

The algorithms used are:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- K-Nearest Neighbors

# Results

The results are as follows:

- Logistic Regression: `0.97`
- Decision Tree: 0.91
- Random Forest: 0.86
- Support Vector Machine: 0.74
- K-Nearest Neighbors: 0.51

# Conclusion

The best algorithm for this dataset is `Logistic Regression` with an `accuracy of 97%`.
